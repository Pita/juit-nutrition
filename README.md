# Juit Nutriton

Just a bit of code to figure out which Juit products fill best my nutrient needs to be able to order the perfect combination of food. I tried to rank the food from best to worst.

Results can be seen in [results.txt](./results.txt)

This is all based on a xhr json dump from the 9th of Feb 2024. The products they offer might be very different now. It's also based on my specific nutrient needs, you might have different goals.
